BLoc using cubit
- Cubits are a simpler way to implementing Bloc,while it does hold some disadvantages.

- Block does provide a structured way to define Bloc pattern as it has specifically defined
  [state], [state] and [Bloc] itself which is to divide every part and that creates a more readable and manageable 
  code, but it does has some boiler plate code pattern and syntax which might be a bit complex and 
  kind of overkill in Blob file for each [event].


- Now in turn Cubit is more convenient and very simpler way to use Bloc as it reduces
  boiler plate code, now it does hold some disadvantages like it does not have separate structure 
  like Bloc pattern's [state], [event] and Bloc itself.


- Now Cubit's pattern only has [state] and [cubit] itself, and is does not have [event] 
  which means we can only create void function for events which also means it does not have 
  two streams like Bloc has for [state] and [event] which helps use to track each of them and 
  Cubit only has one for [state] and for [event] they are just void function we have to write in 
  cubit file which
